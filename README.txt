Secronom V1.0 - Axema Vales

  *Okay, this mod should work with higher versions of android port: 0.C - 0.D builds.
   Since android version is currently stucked at 0.C, I clearly need to use old style of coding (and cope with all bullshit mistakes)
   Have fun with it, and hope to work with other mods ^_^
   
   
   
CURRENT UPDATE (all the 'currently' implemented stuff)
+ADDED CITY ZOMBIE MUTANT VARIANTS (blade, tendril, spider, etc.)
+ADDED SWARMER ZOMBIE VARIANTS (these weak baddies strengthen with time, covering up to 5 years)
